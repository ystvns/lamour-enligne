## <3 love online </3 : navigating connection, relationships and love in the digital age

**<3 love online </3** is a zine examining how our relationship with the internet has affected our relationships with one another - our break-ups, hook-ups, and everything in between. how is digital life affecting the way we love in our wider worlds? 

we're hiring Montreal artists and writers belonging to marginalized groups to contribute pieces; contributors will be paid between $50-100 CAD, depending on how many submissions are accepted. 
we're able to pay artists because of a generous grant from the [Digital Justice Lab](https://digitaljusticelab.ca/).

<3 </3 will be made available digitally (for *free!!*) and physically (PWYC).  we're publishing at the end of March 2019. 


#### who are we? 

our machines run on nonbinary code. we write our scripts with the hope that they'll be rewritten, broken, torn and burned. we are a few millennials who remember what dating was like before the internet, and we want to capture these collective memories before they're lost. we are...

*Gabriela* (she/her - @gab_catalina - Colombiana, writer, powerfemme, researcher / community youth worker)

*Maggie* (she/they - @meochaidha - doing tech activism and digital security training and sometimes art)

#### what we're looking for 

original works - nothing you've published previously elsewhere

pieces that relate directly to our theme (which can be found at the top of this page).

we are looking to support artists who engage with intersectional feminism and anti-oppression, however they define those terms for themselves. 

something that can fit in a zine. if you want to submit work in some medium other than text or image, tell us how you want your work included in the zine. 

works can be submitted in any language. however, if your work is written in a language other than English, French, or Spanish, please provide a translation in one of these languages so that we can make sure your submission aligns with our anti-oppressive values.

short - maximum 1000 words, or 3 8&1/2 x 11 pages.

artwork must be high-resolution. accepted file formats are .xcf, .png, .psd, and .ai.

(due by 23:59 EST on January 25th, 2019) (you don't need to have a finished product to show us at this time). You should include both your application and first draft in the same email, which you can send to **love-online@riseup.net**.

next, we let you know by February 1st if your draft has been accepted for publication. we can offer feedback upon request for pieces that did not make it into the zine, as part of our commitment to a transparent decision-making process. if you accept our offer, we'll send you the first part of your payment at this time.
